# MiniComputer

This is just a simple (so far) application that I am developing to do random things as I learn more with Ruby. 

Feel free to do whatever you want to, with - and while thinking about - this application. 

Critique is always welcomed. You can email me at austingates16@gmail.com, or find me on Twitter. @ausgates

## Installation

$ git clone https://github.com/ausgates/mini_computer


Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mini_computer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mini_computer

## Usage

Do what you please with this. It's probably not going to be usefull to anyone.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
